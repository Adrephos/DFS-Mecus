## Running the project in local:

### 1. Downloading dependencies. 

Go to each folder (client, data-node and name-node) and run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

It is recommended to install the project requirements in a virtual machine, but it is not mandatory. 

### 2. Running the project

Go to the name node folder, run the command

```python name-node.py```

Then, go to bootstrap.py, comment the leader config and uncomment the slave config

then, run the command:

```python name-node.py```

That is how the name-node and the name-node backup start running! After that, run the ```data-node.py``` and the ```client.py``` codes.

That is it! Register an account, login and if not sure about a command, just run the command ```help``` ðŸ’—
